==Neo4j JDBC driver==

This is a first attempt at creating a JDBC driver for the graph database Neo4j. While Neo4j is a graph database, and
JDBC is based on the relational paradigm, this driver provides a way to bridge this gap.

This is done by introducing type nodes in the graph, which are directly related to the root node by the relationship TYPE.
Each type node has a property "type" with its name (i.e. "tablename), and HAS_PROPERTY relationships to nodes that represent
the properties that the node can have (i.e. "columns"). For each instance of this type (i.e. "row") there is a relationship from
the instance to the type node via the IS_A relationship. By using this structure the JDBC driver can mimic a relational database,
and provide a means to execute queries against the Neo4j server.

===Setup===

* Install a Neo4j server, and start it with the REST API enabled.
* Add as many TYPE nodes as you want
* For each type node, add as many HAS_PROPERTY nodes as you want
* For each property node, set property "name" and "type". "type" should be "String" for now
* Add as many instance nodes as you want, with the defined properties, and relate them to their
  type node with the IS_A relationship

===Usage===

* Add the JDBC driver jar file to your applications classpath
* Load the driver with the class +org.neo4j.jdbc.Driver+
* Connect with URLs on the form +jdbc:neo4j://<host>:<port>/+, e.g. +jdbc:neo4j://localhost:7474/+
* Execute queries using the Cypher graph query language

===Using with DbVisualizer===

One of the first tests I did with the driver was to connect to Neo4j using the DbVisualizer tool (www.dbvis.com/).
Here is how you can try it out:
* Download and install DbVIsualizer
* Add the JDBC driver jar as a Neo4j driver in the Driver Manager.
* Add a connection to your database
* Under "Connection properties", change "SQL Statements" as follows:
  * SELECT ALL: start n=node(0) match (n)-[:TYPE]->(type)<-[:IS_A]-(instance) return instance.Firstname
    Column names are hardcoded for now, as there is no * selection in Cypher yet
  * SELECT COUNT: start n=node(0) match (n)-[:TYPE]->(type)<-[:IS_A]-(instance) return count(instance)

Now you should be able to browse the type nodes as tables and the nodes of those types as rows.
Use the "SQL Commander" to issue arbitrary Cypher queries to the Neo4j server
